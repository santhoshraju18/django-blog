The current car is the same generation car as was launched back in 2009, but it has gone through various updates and facelifts through the years. This time round there\u2019s a more powerful T-Jet engine and a handy touchscreen infotainment system.

The current car is the same generation car as was launched back in 2009, but it has gone through various updates and facelifts through the years. This time round there\u2019s a more powerful T-Jet engine and a handy touchscreen infotainment system. We wish though that Fiat had done more to differentiate the 125 S from the regular Linea, apart from just some badging at the rear and A-pillars. We can expect quite a few enthusiasts looking for some visual mods for their cars.",
